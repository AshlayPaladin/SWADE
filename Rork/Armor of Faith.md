##### Armor of Faith
> An energy projected from the cleric's sigil envelopes 

Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 1
Range: Smarts
Duration: 5

*Protection* creates a field of energy or armor around a character, giving him 2 points of Armor, or 4 with a raise.

Whether the protection is visible or not depends on the Trappingâ€”this is entirely up to the caster.

*Protection* stacks with all other armor, natural or worn, and is negated by AP as usual.

**Modifiers**
- **Additional Recipients (+1)**: The power may affect additional targets at a cost of 1 Power Point each.
- **More Armor (+1)**: Success grants 4 points of Armor (+6 with a raise).
- **Toughness (+1)**: Armor provides Toughness instead of Armor and is not affected by AP (magical or otherwise).
