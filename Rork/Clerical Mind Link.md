##### Clerical Mind Link
> A single streak of red and yellow energy wisps quickly through the air in the direction that you point your finger. The energy is unwieldy, blinding, and hot. It leaves behind it a trail of heat and white smoke.

Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 1
Range: Smarts
Duration: 30 minutes

*Mind Link* creates a telepathic connection between two individuals (which does not necessarily have to include the caster). The link accommodates only willing subjects and communication—thoughts that aren’t consciously transmitted aren’t relayed.

Once activated, the Range between all linked minds is one mile, or five with a raise.

If any of the linked characters suffers a Wound, all others must make a Smarts roll or be Shaken (this cannot cause a Wound).

The speed of communication is that of normal speech, but with a raise members may communicate up to 30 seconds or so of speech on a single combat turn.
