Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant

*Healing* removes Wounds less than an hour old. A success removes one Wound, and a raise removes two. The power may be cast additional times to remove additional Wounds within that hour and as long as the healer has enough Power Points.

For Extras, the GM must first determine if the ally is still alive (see Aftermath). If so, a successful arcane skill roll returns the ally to action (Shaken if it matters).

**Modifiers**
- **Greater Healing (+10)**: Greater healing can restore any Wound, including those more than an hour old.
- **Crippling Injuries (+20)**: The power can heal a permanent Crippling Injury (see Incapacitation). This requires an hour of preparation and only one casting is permitted per injury. If it fails, this caster cannot heal that particular injury (but somoene else may try). If successful, the subject is Exhausted for 24 hours.
- **Neutralize Poison or Disease (+1)**: A successful healing roll negates any poison or disease. If the poison or disease has a bonus or penalty associated with it, the modifier applies to the arcane skill roll as well.
