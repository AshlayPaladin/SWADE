This power grants basic control over the four traditional elements: air, earth, fire, and water (the elements may vary depending on the setting). The power acts as if it has a d6 Strength, or d8 with a raise.

Here are some ideas for what each element can do. Each is an action.

- **Air**: Push someone, blow out a torch, fan a flame, cool someone down (+2 to Fatigue rolls in oppressive heat).
- **Earth**: Move a square foot of earth (half that in stone) each round, cover tracks.
- **Fire**: Conjure flame about the size of a torch, hurl a small blast of fire at someone (Str damage), spread existing flame (see Fire).
- **Water**: Conjure a quart of water (not "inside" objects or people), purify a gallon of water per casting.
