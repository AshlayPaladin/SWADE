##### *Advise*
> Through the ethereal flow, you implant a simple thought into the mind of your target.

Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 2
Range: Smarts
Duration: Instant

*Advise* is an opposed roll versus the target’s Smarts. Success allows the character to plant one idea into the subject's mind. This idea must be expressed within one or two sentences and must sound reasonable to the creature's own mind. Courses of action that would result in immediate self-harm, such as stabbing oneself, will immediately fail.

If the casting is failed, the target is aware of the mental intrusion unless the caster gets a raise. The GM may apply modifiers based on the subject’s mental Hindrances or current state of mind.
