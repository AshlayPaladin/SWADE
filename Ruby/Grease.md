##### *Grease*

Rank: Novice
Mana Cost: 1
Range: Smarts x2
Duration: Instant

*Grease* unleashes an odorless liquid onto a surface up to the spell's range. The liquid then spreads out to cover an area equivalent to a Medium Blast Template. After the power's duration, the Grease liquid evaporates on its own and is no longer considered an obstacle.

Creatures attempting to pass through *Grease*'s affected area must succeed an Agility test. On a failure, the creature falls prone. There is no test required to stand back up.

Using Modifiers, the liquid produced by *Grease* can have other traits, but by default is only a slippery surface.

**Modifiers**
- **Combustable (+1)**: The liquid becomes combustable, and can be lit ablaze. Doing so immediately lights the entire Grease surface. Creatures may still fall prone to the liquid. If a creature ends its turn in the flames, they are dealt 2d6 Fire damage.
- **Conductive (+1)**: The liquid allows Lightning-based energy to pass through it, immediately dealing that damage equivalent to all creatures standing in it that are not resistant to Lightning or wearing non-conductive footwear.
